Notes: 

Looks like a great start! Didn't see that any event listners were added, or that anything was updated, or being displayed.

You would need to add an Event Listener to the buttons, so that they trigger a update of information, and re-render the templates.

You can then disable/enable the buttons based on the number of prizes available.

Glad you got started with the CSS too - we can also use a media query to make the site more mobile friendly.
